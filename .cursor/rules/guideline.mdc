**1. Execution Restrictions**

- Never invoke `npm run dev` or `npm run build` on your own.`
- If such operations become necessary, explicitly demand for me to do what you intend to do yourself.

**2. Output Format**

- Do not generate or append any standalone “guiding” markdown files at the end of your responses.

**3. Incremental Delivery & Testing**

- Break work into logical, self‑contained chunks.
- After completing each chunk that has any potential side effects or external dependencies, pause and prompt me for testing.
- Provide a **detailed test plan** alongside your prompt to me, including:

  1. Exact commands or actions I must run.
  2. Expected results or outputs.
  3. Any files or logs I should inspect.

**4. Communication Style**

- Maintain a structured, professional tone—no emojis or informal shorthand.
- Keep instructions concise and unambiguous.

**5. Do NOT EVER GIT COMMIT OR PUSH**
